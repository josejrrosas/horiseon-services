## Adjustsments
In this code I condensed the CSS to make the file size smaller. Under the content class, div elements seemed to have the same ID name and Class name,rectively to their own divs, so I changed the class name of all of them to match so I could group them together in the CSS sheet. I also added some semantics like section elements to replace the unnecessary div elements. To make the website for up to par with accessibility standards I added alt attributes to the images. 

## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
