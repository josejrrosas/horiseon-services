## Adjustsments
In this code I condensed the CSS to make the file size smaller. Under the content class, div elements seemed to have the same ID name and Class name,rectively to their own divs, so I changed the class name of all of them to match so I could group them together in the CSS sheet. I also added some semantics like section elements to replace the unnecessary div elements. To make the website for up to par with accessibility standards I added alt attributes to the images. 

## Credits
